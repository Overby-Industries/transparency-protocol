# 📜 OTB‑1: Overby Transparency for Business v1
OTB‑1 defines the standard JSON schema for publicly reporting business expenditures, infrastructure projects, and material procurements.

## 🌍 Purpose
This format allows investors, regulators, and the public to transparently verify WHERE funds are spent and WHAT assets are acquired in pursuit of Overby’s roadmap (airfields, hangars, labs, materials).

## 🧩 Core OTB‑1 JSON Schema
```json
{
  "version": "OTB-1",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-14T14:00:00Z",
  "investment": {
    "id": "INV-2025-0001",
    "type": "land",
    "item": "50 acres for Overby Airfield Development",
    "status": "completed"
  },
  "financials": {
    "costUSD": 2200000,
    "vendor": "AeroLand Realty LLC",
    "fundingSource": "Early Supporter Funds"
  },
  "location": {
    "site": "West Texas",
    "coordinates": {
      "lat": 31.9686,
      "lon": -99.9018
    }
  },
  "certifications": {
    "SMESSC_Applicable": false,
    "OTB_Audit": true,
    "ProofOfInvestmentToken": "0xinv20250001"
  }
}
```
## 🛰️ Field Definitions
- `version`: must be `"OTB-1"`.
- `timestamp`: UTC ISO timestamp of purchase/contract execution.
- `investment`: object describing ID, category, item, and current status (`planned`, `in-progress`, `completed`).
- `financials`:
  - `costUSD` → total cost
  - `vendor` → vendor/dealer/contractor
  - `fundingSource` → "Donations", "Capital Round A", etc.
- `location`:
  - `site` → description/string
  - `coordinates` → optional Lat/Lon.
- `certifications`:
  - `OTB_Audit` flag → if entry has been verified by Overby auditors.
  - `ProofOfInvestmentToken` → immutable blockchain token proving this item exists in ledger.
  - `SMESSC_Applicable` → flag if investment links to operational sustainability certification.

## 🔗 Certifications & Extensions
- OTB Audit ✅ → Every item logged is audited by Overby internal + optionally external auditors for accuracy.
- Proof of Investment Token (PoI Credit) 🔗 → Each line item issues a blockchain token just like PoC credits.
*Example: `INV-2025-0001` → `0xinv20250001` on ledger.*
- SMESSC Linkage ♻️ → If investment is directly related to mining/facility operations, it inherits SMESSC accountability.
- ODCI Crossover 📊 → If investment leads to orbital capacity increase (like deploying new reclaimer pods), item can cross-credit ODCI transparency.

## ✅ Why OTB‑1 Matters
- Investor Trust → Every dollar logged, every project trackable.
- Supporter Engagement → Crowdfunding donors literally see “Our money bought X acres of land.”
- Operational Legitimacy → Regulators view Overby as radically transparent.
- ESG Compliance → Aligns with global compliance narratives (carbon credits → orbital credits → now investment credits).
- Twin Ledger with OTF‑1 → Full Overby Transparency Stack:
  - 🌌 OTF‑1 = orbital telemetry trust
  - 🌍 OTB‑1 = Earth business trust
